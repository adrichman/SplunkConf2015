# Recursive Splunking

Building a data Rube Goldberg with Splunk 

by NY Air Brake (Railroads)

## Problem

Assets and devices from new to 40 years old

Everything speaks a different, proprietary protocol

No unifying body driving standardization

Devices are digitally isolated

Mix between machine data and calculated data 

## Creating a Single Source of Truth

must:
* collect and aggregate data
* normalize data in the time domain
* feature engineering (do something interesting)

### Aggregating & Normalizing Data
* Aggregation schema
* Field mapping and aliasing
* Data transform
    - preprocess data inputs using dynamic data from Splunk 

## Recursive Splunking

Splunk -> Train Dynamics Models -> Splunk Analytics
Splunk -> Train Dynamics Models -> External Analytics

Extend the Splunk Query Language

Utilize Data Models - external process calls

## Splunk as a Data Science Platform

Math and Stats Knowledge | Software Enginerings | Substantive Expertise

Buisiness Intelligence

Stats

Database mgmt

Visualizations

Predictive and prescriptive analytics so that _Business Intelligence_ is __actionable__
